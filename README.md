# -Hello-World
What is this? Where am I?
Do I double-click here?

Wait what's the indent size?
	eight is pretty intense.
		I kinda like it.
			But I do tend to write in a strange way
				Or nest enough loop and conditional statements to cause
					a lot of comments and such that run on like the following to force word wrap if it's set. How does that affect how the code looks on github?
								Well
									These are all single tabs
										Wonder if that would look weird in the editor.
